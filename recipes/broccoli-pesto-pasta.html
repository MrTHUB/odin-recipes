    <img src="../img/broccoli-pesto-pasta.jpg" width="400" height="242" alt="Broccoli Pesto Image">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    Broccoli florets that are whizzed right into the pesto sauce itself, adding an even more vibrant punch of emerald green to the sauce as well as a serious nutritional boost. In addition to being a great source of fiber, this dark green member of the brassica family boasts lots of vitamin C and vitamin A, as well as some iron, calcium and potassium. Blended into a classic pesto along with some of the pasta cooking water, broccoli gives this pesto sauce just a bit of creaminess and a lot more oomph. 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1 lb cooked pasta of your choice, pasta water reserved</li>
        <li>4 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2 cups basil leaves, lightly packed</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>¼ cup pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt
