    <p><b>Method</b></p>
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with 
        noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>

    <ol><li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li> Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</ol></ol>
    
        <p><b>How to Store and Reheat Leftovers</b></p>
        <p>Half the pleasure of making a lasagna is enjoying the leftovers! The lasagna will keep in the fridge for at least 5 days.</p>
        <p>Reheat individual slices in the microwave, or warm the whole casserole (covered with foil) in the oven at 350Â°F until bubbly again.</p>
